These steps are based on Josh Sanders's indications in https://sites.google.com/site/bpoddocumentation/installing-bpod/ubuntu14.Follow his suggestions for installing Bpod firmware.

1.Install Ubuntu:
If the new computer has already Windows installed, you can keep it by making a dual Windows/Ubuntu boot. For that, shrink the Windows partition to a sensible size (100Gb) and select manually create partitions during Ubuntu instalation. Design your partition table by allocating space for swap, root and home.

2. Install the linux- lowlatency package: 
Run sudo apt-get install linux-lowlatency

3. Install Git:
Run "sudo apt-get install git"

4. Install Matlab

5. Close Matlab. Open a terminal window and add yourself to the “dialout” group:
    sudo usermod -a -G dialout "username"

6. Explain to MATLAB that /dev/ttyACMx are valid serial ports:
from terminal, launch the editor as root. Run: sudo gedit
Paste the following line into the text editor:

    -Dgnu.io.rxtx.SerialPorts=/dev/ttyS0:/dev/ttyS1:/dev/USB0:/dev/ttyACM0

Save the file as java.opts to the following location:

    /usr/local/MATLAB/R2011a/bin/glnxa64

7. Set the sound subsystem to “no attenuation”:
From terminal, run: alsamixer
Ensure that Card: shows Xonar DX. Select each slider *EXCEPT for the front L&R* and use the mouse scroll wheel to maximize (0dB gain)
Press “Esc” to save and exit. Without this step, audio card sync pulses will not be sent.

8. Clone the Bpod-ZadorLab folder from github. Open a Terminal and run:
git clone  https://github.com/fedecarne/Bpod-ZadorLab.git.
git pull

9. Add Bpod-ZadorLab to Matlab path
(.gitignore data)

10. Install PsychToolbox package "octave-psychtoolbox-3" from http://psychtoolbox.org/download/#Linux
which opens from the Ubuntu Software Manager. Then run the Matlab script DownloadAdditionsForLinux.m which is in the psychotoolbox folder.

11. If you have a Windows server in which to synchronize data from several rigs. 
Get the name of the server (servername) and the name of the folder in which you want your data (sharename) and run:
sudo apt-get install cifs-utils
sudo mkdir /media/windowsshare
//servername/sharename  /media/windowsshare  cifs  username=msusername,password=mspassword,iocharset=utf8,sec=ntlm  0  0
sudo mount -a
